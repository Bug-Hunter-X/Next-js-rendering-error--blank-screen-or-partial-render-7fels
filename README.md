# Next.js Rendering Error: Blank Screen or Partial Render

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where the page fails to render correctly, resulting in a blank screen or a partial render.  The problem stems from improper use of asynchronous operations within the component's rendering logic.

## Problem
The provided `pages/index.js` file contains a simple component. However, if you try to incorporate asynchronous data fetching (e.g., using `fetch` or `SWR`), and handle the loading/error states incorrectly, you can easily introduce a rendering problem. The issue is not immediately obvious but can significantly affect the user experience. 

## Solution
The solution is provided in the `bugSolution.js` file, which addresses this rendering issue by implementing proper error handling and loading states.
